            My journey from failing forward in UPSC to making a comeback in tech has been full of ups and downs.
            It was a physically, mentally, and emotionally draining experience, but taught me how to fight as a lone warrior and grow from failures.
            I also firmly believe in the supreme power - God, and I know that good things do come your way sooner or later.<br/><br/>
            
            I am extremely blessed to have landed among the nicest and smartest people at Airbase. Really excited to learn new things and grow! <br/><br/>

            But none of this would have been possible without my mother's constant support. Whatever I do and however I do it, she always says one thing: 'Do what makes you happy!' <br/><br/>
            
            This one's for her! ❤️
